## The Core Problem: Inefficiencies in Pharmacy Operations

- **Stockouts & Wastage:** Manual tracking, inaccurate forecasting leading to vital medicine shortages.
- **Suboptimal Patient Care:** Generic recommendations, limited access to critical drug information.
- **Resource Strain:** Overburdened pharmacists, time-consuming manual record reviews.
- **Affordability Barriers:** Patients unable to access vital medications due to cost.
